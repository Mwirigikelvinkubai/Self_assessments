    "Low Burnout Risk": {
      "characteristics": "Energy and engagement are generally healthy. Occasional stress is present but manageable. You can recharge with routine rest and boundaries.",
      "strengths": "Resilience, good recovery habits, effective boundaries, meaning and satisfaction in work.",
      "blindspots": "Early warning signs can be easy to dismiss; you might normalize rising stress until it spikes.",
      "advice": "Maintain protective habits: regular breaks, sleep, movement, and social connection. Continue setting boundaries around after-hours communication and workload. Do a quick weekly check-in on energy, mood, and workload to catch changes early."
    },
    "Moderate Burnout Risk": {
      "characteristics": "Noticeable fatigue, irritability, and/or reduced satisfaction. You may be working harder yet feeling less effective, with more cynicism creeping in.",
      "strengths": "Awareness of stressors; motivation to improve; capacity to adjust routines and negotiate workload.",
      "blindspots": "Pushing through without changes can raise risk quickly. Sleep and recovery often get sacrificed first.",
      "advice": "Identify top 2â€“3 stress drivers (e.g., workload, role clarity, recognition). Set clear priorities and limits, schedule micro-breaks, and protect sleep. Discuss workload and expectations with a supervisor. Reconnect with meaning in your role; increase restorative activities outside work. Consider peer support or coaching."
    },
    "High Burnout Risk": {
      "characteristics": "Significant exhaustion, detachment/cynicism, and reduced sense of effectiveness. Work may feel overwhelming and recovery is difficult.",
      "strengths": "Clear signal that change is needed now; your insight can guide effective support and boundaries.",
      "blindspots": "Delaying support increases risk of health issues, relationship strain, and mistakes at work.",
      "advice": "Seek support promptly: speak with a supervisor about workload adjustment or time off; use EAP or counseling if available; consider a healthcare professional to address sleep, mood, or physical symptoms. Reduce non-essential tasks, delegate where possible, and strengthen daily recovery (sleep, nutrition, movement, brief relaxation). If you experience thoughts of self-harm or feel unsafe, contact local emergency services or a crisis line immediately."
